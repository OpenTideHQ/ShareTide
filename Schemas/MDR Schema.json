You can use up to\nthree identifiers for a single entity mapping.\n\nFor best results - for guaranteed unique identification - you should use identifiers from the **strongest\nidentifiers** column whenever possible. The use of multiple strong identifiers enables correlation\nbetween strong identifiers from varying data sources and schemas.
