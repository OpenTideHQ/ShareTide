    Requires an already compromised endpoint.

    Doing pass-the-hash on a Windows system requires specific privilege. 
    It either requires elevated privileges (by previously running 
    privilege:debug or by executing Mimikatz as the NT-AUTHORITY\SYSTEM 
    account). This doesn't apply to pass-the-ticket which uses an official API.

    Pth works on windows computers of every kind, however later versions 
    natively have some level of defenses/mitigations built in.
  targets:
    - Auth token
    - Control Server
    - Workstations
    - End-user
    - Public-Facing Servers
    - Server Authentication
    - Laptop
    - Desktop
  platforms:
    - Windows
  severity: Significant incident
  leverage:
    - Elevation of privilege
    - Information Disclosure
    - Spoofing
    - Tampering
    - Repudiation
  impact:
    - Identity Theft
    - Impairement
    - Data Breach
  viability: Very Likely
  description: |
     Elevating privileges on Windows to System allows a threat actor (or 
     sysadmin) to do things that are not possible without SYSTEM/root 
     privileges.
     
     Pass the hash is a method of authenticating as a user, without having 
     access to the user's cleartext password, by stealing password hashes and 
     using this password hash to authenticate directly to a resource via a 
     third party non-Microsoft tool such as Mimikatz. This method bypasses 
     standard authentication steps that require a cleartext password, moving
     directly into the portion of the authentication that uses the password 
     hash.
     
     Mimikatz sekurlsa module without the /impersonate option implements the standard
     pass-the-hash technique, which works by authenticating to a resource, by in the 
     background spawning a new process in the context of the hash and attacker-
     desired elements. For examples, see the reference to thehacker.recipes.
