    If adversaries have physical access to the device, they can install a jailbreaking tool
    that include the neccesary exploit. If no physical access is available, it is possible
    to exploit a zero-day vuln to bypass the device' security mechanisms.

    Jailbreaking an iPhone involves bypassing Apple's security restrictions to gain 
    root access to the device, allowing users to install unauthorized apps, tweaks, 
    and customizations. While this can provide enhanced functionality, it also introduces 
    significant security risks. Below is an analysis of the threat vector associated 
    with jailbreaking tools based on the provided sources.

    ### Jailbreaking Tools

    Jailbreaking tools exploit vulnerabilities in iOS to remove Apple's restrictions. 
    These tools vary depending on the iOS version and device type. For example:
    - **Taurine** works for iOS 14.0–14.8.1.
    - **Dopamine 2.x** supports iOS 15.0–16.6.1 on certain devices.
    - **PaleRa1n** is used for older devices (A11 and below) running iOS 15–17.

    These tools often leverage kernel vulnerabilities to enable capabilities such as 
    tweak injection, theming, and sideloading apps.

    ### Types of jailbreaks:

    1. Tethered jailbreak: Requires the device to be connected to a computer to boot into
        a jailbroken state.

    2. Semi-tethered jailbreak: Allows the device to boot into a jailbroken state without
       being connected to a computer, but may require a computer to re-jailbreak the device
       after a reboot.

    3. Untethered jailbreak: Allows the device to boot into a jailbroken state without being
       connected to a computer, and the jailbreak is preserved even after a reboot.

    ### Security Risks of Jailbreaking

    1. **Exploitation of Vulnerabilities**:
      - Jailbreaking tools exploit known vulnerabilities in iOS, which inherently weakens 
      the device's security posture. Once jailbroken, the device becomes more susceptible 
      to malware and unauthorized access.

    2. **Loss of System Integrity**:
      - Jailbreaking modifies the core system files, potentially leading to instability, 
      crashes, or bricking of the device.

    3. **Exposure to Malicious Software**:
      - Many jailbreak tweaks and apps are distributed outside of Apple's App Store, 
      increasing the risk of installing malicious software.

    4. **Bypassing Security Features**:
      - Features like Secure Enclave and sandboxing are compromised in a jailbroken 
      environment, exposing sensitive data such as passwords and encryption keys.

    5. **No Official Support**:
      - Apple does not support jailbroken devices, leaving users without official updates 
      or security patches.

    ### Current Status of Jailbreak Tools
    - For newer iOS versions (iOS 17 and 18), no full jailbreak tools are publicly available 
    yet. However, semi-jailbreak solutions like MisakaX and Nugget exist for limited customization.
    - Older versions (iOS 15 to 16) have stable jailbreaks like Dopamine and PaleRa1n with 
    tweak support.
