    The attack requires Windows hosts with interactive users who have the
    ability to open File Explorer or paste into the Explorer address bar.
    The browser must allow JavaScript to run (standard), and the victim must
    be able to interactively paste content from the clipboard into the Explorer
    address bar or other UI (e.g., Run dialog).

    - Workstations

    The `FileFix` technique is a new social engineering method similar to
    `ClickFix` attack. `FileFix` is used by the threat actors to abuse Windows
    Explorer and execute malicious commands on a compromised system. This
    technique takes advantage of the Windows Explorer feature that allows users
    to specify a custom executable to open a file with. The goal of this
    technique is to harvest user's credentials. Threat actor can execute
    commands through the user's Windows Explorer and deploy further a loader
    which drops infostealer, harvesting browsers, wallets and cloud credentials
    ref [1],[2].

    Unlike `ClickFix`, which tricks users into running malicious commands via
    the Windows Run dialog, `FileFix` takes a subtler approach: A malicious
    webpage will open a legitimate File Explorer window while covertly copying
    a disguised PowerShell one-liner into the clipboard. The user is then asked
    to paste into the Explorer address bar (or otherwise paste into a UI), and
    the pasted content runs in the user context, often invoking PowerShell to
    download and execute follow-on payloads ref [1].  

    ### How FileFix Works

    - User Interaction: The attack typically begins when a user is lured to a
      compromised website that prompts them to perform actions that seem benign, 
      such as opening File Explorer to access a shared document.
    - Clipboard Manipulation: The website uses JavaScript to copy a malicious
      PowerShell command to the clipboard while simultaneously opening a File
      Explorer window.
    - Execution: The user is instructed to paste the clipboard content into the
      File Explorer address bar, which leads to the execution of the malicious
      command.

    To the victims, this process appears to be a simple task of opening a shared
    file or folder, making it feel routine and safe. This subtle manipulation
    makes `FileFix` a more stealthy and potentially more dangerous evolution of
    the `ClickFix` social engineering attack.
