        Malicious spearphishing campaign can use a typosquatting domain

    A threat actor use vulnerabilities in domain providers to buy similar
    to a legit domain and to use them for malicious purposes.

    Usually the threat actors are buying as much as possible domains
    on a bulk with impersonation goal, social engineering or just spreading
    disinformation.
  targets:
    - Customer
    - End-user
    - Email Platform
    - Other # Domain, ISP and domain providers
    - Public-Facing Servers
  platforms:
    - Windows
    - Linux
  severity: Moderate incident
  leverage:
    - Spoofing # a web page looks similar and pretends to be a legitimate one
    - Infrastructure Compromise
  impact:
    - Impairement
    - Asset and fraud
    - Identity Theft # Impersonation

    Typosquatting, also known as URL hijacking, is a form of cyber attack
    where an attacker registers a domain name that is very similar to a
    legitimate and popular website, often by exploiting common typing
    errors or misspellings. This is done to deceive users into visiting
    the fake domain, usually with the intention of spreading disinformation,
    stealing personal information, or installing malware ref [1].  

    In the context of disinformation, typosquatting can be used to create
    a fake version of a trusted news source or government website in order
    to spread false or misleading information. By exploiting users' trust
    in familiar domain names, attackers can manipulate public opinion,
    confusion, and undermine the credibility of legitimate sources.  

    Threat actors can impersonate domains in different ways.

    Some of them are:

    - A common misspelling of the target domain (example: CSOnline.com rather than CSOOnline.com)
    - A different top-level domain (example: using .uk rather than .co.uk)
    - Combining related words into the domain (CSOOnline-Cybersecurity.com)
    - Adding periods to the URL (CSO.Online.com)
    - Using similar looking letters to hide the false domain (ÇSÓOnliné.com)

    Typosquatting is a lookalike domain with one or two wrong or different
    characters with the aim of trying to trick people onto the wrong webpage.

    The threat actors can buy and use a domain only with a little change
    compared to the legitimate and official site of some service.
    It can be difficult for the end user to recognise the difference, for
    example between goggle.com and google.com or google.com written with
    similar character for the character "o" but actually from different
    UTF encoding system. It can looks like a well known and legit
    domain but to be actually a malicious one with a very close name.

    In some of the cases regarding the security reports typosquatting
    domain attack is used in malicious campaigns for disinformation.
    For example, Doppelganger is a pro-Russian misleading information
    operation targeting the European Union (EU) and other geopolitical
    actors. This campaign exploits political, economic, and social
    divisions within the EU and its member states. 

    Such campaigns usually use deception techniques, such as typosquatting
    legitimate domain and creating fake media outlets hosted on domains,
    impersonating legitimate news outlets. Their goal is to disseminate
    disinformation and mislead the users who visit and read them. ref [a].
