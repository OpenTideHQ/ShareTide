       In one of the ransomware campaigns is observed that the threat actors
       are purchasing intentionally Teams accounts which are used further for
       impersonation purposes. Example: 3AM Ransomware activities. 

       Further the threat actor groups use these accounts for Teams-vishing,
       which means using “email bombing” to overload a targeted organisation's
       employees with unwanted emails, and then making a voice or video call
       over Microsoft Teams posing as a tech support team member to deceive
       that employee into allowing remote access to their computer ref [1].

    IT support impersonation via spoofed phone calls is a common social
    engineering technique used by attackers to gain initial access to an
    organisation's network. This tactic is often combined with other
    techniques, such as email flooding or phishing, to create a sense
    of urgency and legitimacy. To deceive victims, attackers may use
    one of the following methids:

    - Use spoofed phone numbers: The threat actors can use spoofed phone
    numbers that appear to be from the organisation's IT department or a
    legitimate company.  
    - Create a sense of urgency: Attackers may claim that there is a critical
    issue with the victim's computer or account that requires immediate
    attention.
    - Use technical jargon: Some threat actor groups are observed to use
    technical terms and acronyms to sound legitimate and knowledgeable.
    - Request remote access: Attackers may ask the victim to grant remote
    access to their computer or network, often through tools like Zoom,
    Anydesk, Any Connect, TeamViewer or Microsoft Quick Assist.    

    ### Possible scenario
    
    Threat actor groups are targeting an organisation by gathering variety of
    user's data, for example, employee email addresses and the IT department's
    phone number. They can flood an employee with unsolicited emails and then
    impersonate IT support via a spoofed phone call, tricking the employee
    into granting remote access through `Microsoft Quick Assist` ref [1].   
    
    Because `Quick Assist` uses the RDP stack (T1021.001), the attacker gains
    an RDP session under the user's context. If the targeted users has extended
    rights, the attacker can sidesteps perimeter ACLs, and disables input
    monitoring. A hidden admin account is added ref [1], [3]:  
    
    ```
    *net user svc_updater P@ss123! /add*,
    *net localgroup administrators svc_updater /add*)
    ```
    
    and a signed Hyper-V VHDX (`*windows_storage.vhdx*`) containing Cobalt
    Strike and the 3AM encryptor is transferred over SMB. Credential dumping
    from *lsass.exe* and *net group "domain admins" /DOMAIN* follow, before
    the payload encrypts mapped drives and drops *README_3AM.txt*.  

    By performing such attack, the threat actor maintains persistence and
    can exfiltrates available data towards any server he controls.
