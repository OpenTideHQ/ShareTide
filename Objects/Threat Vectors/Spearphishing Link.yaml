     Spear phishing requires more preparation and time to achieve success than
     a phishing attack. That is because spear-phishing attackers attempt to
     obtain vast amounts of personal information about their victims,  
     the entities their work for, or their areas of interest.  

     Attackers can get the personal information they need using different ways:
     to compromise an email or messaging system trough other means, to use OSINT,
     scouring Social Media or glean personal information from the user's online
     presence.       
  targets:
    - Email Platform
    - End-user
    - Mobile phone
  platforms:
    - Windows
    - Office 365
    - Android

    Adversaries may send spearphishing emails with a malicious link in an
    attempt to gain access to victim systems. This sub-technique employs
    the use of links to download malware, instead of attaching malicious
    files to the email itself to avoid defences that may inspect email
    attachments.      
    
    All forms of spearphishing are targeted at a specific individual or
    company. Generally, the links will be accompanied by social engineering
    text and require the user to actively click or copy and paste an URL into
    a browser, leveraging user execution. The visited website may compromise
    the web browser using an exploit, or the user will be prompted to download
    applications, documents, zip files, or even executables depending on the
    pretext for the email in the first place. Attackers may also include links
    that are intended to interact directly with an email reader, including
    embedded images intended to exploit the end system directly or verify
    the receipt of an email (i.e. web bugs/web beacons).  

    In this type of phishing a threat actor impersonates to appear as
    a user's trusted contact like their colleague or other known friends.
    Threat actors can also impersonate a large companies with trustworthy
    image, brand and reputation to give the emails more believability and
    reach. They put deceptive links in the email to entice a victim to
    click on the link ref [4, 5].        

    In some of the spearphishing campaigns, a threat actor named Webworm
    was using GitHub malicious repositories and links to them to spread and
    infect more developers and end-users. As GitHub is one of the top million
    domains with a lot of visits and clicks the attacker's goal is to hide
    in plain sight.   

    #### AI-themed phishing campaigns

    Adversaries create spearphishing links or sites that mimic AI
    applications, which appear to offer legitimate AI tools, tricking
    users into downloading and executing trojanised AI-themed software.
    For example, this could lead to the installation of Gipy malware,
    a strain of infostealer malware that steals sensitive information
    and loads additional malicious software from GitHub, including
    various types of information stealers and remote access trojans.  

    #### Themed-documents lure campaigns 

    Several reports mention that the threat actors prepare their campaign 
    by using areas of activity and visual identity of companies or public 
    administrations in contact with the targets in order to craft more 
    deceiving and appealing emails to lure the targets. This preparation
    aims to raise the successful rate of the phishing campaigns.  

    Spearphishing emails prepared to deal with topics in the areas of an 
    Union entity may decive more Union entity staff to follow the link.
    ref [b].  

    In one campaign it was observed that after direct exchanges over emails 
    and whatsapp messages, the victim received an email having a specifically 
    crafted politically oriented subject with a malicious link ref [e].    
   
    #### Spearphishing via QR Codes (Quishing)
    ##### Description

    Spearphishing via QR codes, also known as "quishing," is an emerging
    cybersecurity threat where attackers use malicious QR codes to target
    specific individuals or organizations. This technique combines the
    deceptive nature of phishing with the convenience of QR codes to trick
    victims into revealing sensitive information or compromising their
    devices.  

    ##### **How Quishing Works**

    1. Attackers generate a QR code that leads to a falsified website or
    malicious content.
    2. The malicious QR code is distributed through various channels, such as
    emails, social media, or even physical locations.
    3. Victims are lured into scanning the QR code, often under the guise of
    accessing exclusive content or necessary information.
    4. Upon scanning, users are directed to phishing websites or trigger the
    download of malware.  

    #### Spearphishing with enbedded HTML link
    ##### Description

    Embedded HTML links in the context of spear phishing, refer
    to malicious links that are embedded within an email or message
    using HTML code. These links may appear legitimate from a trusted 
    source or known organization but actually they mask their true
    destionation. For example, they can be encoded or obfuscated
    to hide their source destination.  

    Example: 

    In one of the reports was observed that clicking a malicious HTML
    link redirected a victim first to malicious HubSpot Free Forms and then
    to credential harvesting pages mimicking Microsoft Azure and Outlook Web
    App (OWA) login portals ref [d].
