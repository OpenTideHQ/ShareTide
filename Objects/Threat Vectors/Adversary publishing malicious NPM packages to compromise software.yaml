        With a high confidence this campaign is associated with a group operating
        in support of North Korean objectives, known as Jade Sleet or also known
        as TraderTraitor. Jade Sleet mostly targets users associated with
        cryptocurrency and other blockchain-related organizations,
        but also targets vendors used by those firms.

       sighting: |
        Various threat actor profiles, ranging from low-profile cybercriminals
        to advanced state-sponsored groups like North Korea's Lazarus cluster,
        have leveraged malicious npm packages to compromise software supply
        chains.

  description: |
    Threat actors use a technique which includes updating of NPM packages
    with malicious code to deceive a developer or an end-user to download
    and install them. This attack vector is used to steal profile and
    system data from the developer's systems.    

    In one of the threat actor's campaigns was observed that multiple
    cryptocurrency-related packages are targeted, and the popular
    country-currency-map package was downloaded thousands of times
    a week. The malicious code is found in two heavily obfuscated
    scripts, "/scripts/launch.js" and "/scripts/diagnostic-report.js,"
    which execute upon the package installation ref [1].    

    The threat actor steals the device's environment variables and sends
    them to a remote host. The threat actor's groups are targeting environment
    variables as they can contain API keys, database credentials, cloud
    credentials, and encryption keys, which can be used for further attacks.
