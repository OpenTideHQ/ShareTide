  description: |
    Development and DevOps teams may turn on signed commits to ensure that an 
    attacker cannot commit code to a code repository of an organization by 
    merely succesfully stealing an OAuth token of a developer. With forced 
    commits, the attacker will be blocked from committing code changes to a
    repository, essentially limiting the attacker from attaining lateral 
    movement or similar objectives, unless the attacker turns off the forced 
    commit policy.
