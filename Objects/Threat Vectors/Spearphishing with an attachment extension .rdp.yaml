    A threat actor relies on an email attachment lure.
    In this case a malicious file is masquerading as a RDP file
    in an attempt to deceive a victim about their identity and
    true nature of the file. The spear-phishing attachment provides
    a threat actor an initial access to the system.

    Spearphishing with an attachment extension .rdp refers to a targeted
    cyberattack where a malicious actor sends an email containing a file
    with the file extension .RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) to a specific
    individual or organization. The attacker may send an attachment to
    the end-users directly or by impersonating companies, institutions
    or particular individuals, sending the lure on behalf of them
    ref [1, 2].       
    
    On October 22, 2024, the National Cyber Security Centers (NCSC) of two
    EU countries, as well as governmental organizations [3] reported that
    a spear-phishing campaign with .RDP attachment are impersonating their
    entities.      

    The emails were highly targeted, using social engineering lures relating
    to Microsoft, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and the concept of Zero Trust.
    The emails contained a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) configuration file
    signed with a LetsEncrypt certificate. RDP configuration (.RDP) files
    summarize automatic settings and resource mappings that are established
    when a successful connection to an RDP server occurs ref [1].       
    
    This allows the adversary to potentially deploy additional payloads,
    execute local reconnaissance activities, and to redirect targeted users
    to credential harvesting sites.
