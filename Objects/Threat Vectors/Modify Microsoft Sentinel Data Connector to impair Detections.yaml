  description: |
    A threat actor may want to disable, remove or update the configuration of
    Sentinel Connectors to act invisibly in Azure, which would impair the ability
    of a SOC to receive alerts since it would stop log file ingestion into Azure
    Sentinel. 

    An attacker can do this either by deploying via API an ARM template, biceps
    template, or other script/code element that can be used via Azure APIs,
    using the Azure CLI or directly on the portal itself via a browser.

#Make sure that in the future this TVM is linked to implementation grade TVMs: 
#each of the method listed above should become its own object, connected to others.
#This helps with avoiding repetition across models.
