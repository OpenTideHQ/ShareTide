  description: |
    C2 beaconing refers to the periodic communication between a compromised
    system and a Command and Control (C2) server. The packets are sent from the
    infected host to the C2 server at regular intervals, known as the `beacon
    interval`, which can be down to the second to avoid suspicion. For example,
    a Cobalt Strike beacon might have an average sleep of several seconds with
    jitter added to disrupt the pattern. The compromised system, often is
    referred as a "beacon" sends periodic signals or "beacons" to the C2 for
    one of the following reasons ref [1].

    - Check for new commands or updates
    - Report back on its status or activities
    - Receive instructions or configuration changes
    - C2 beaconing on specific time intervals

    To avoid detection, attackers often configure the compromised system to
    beacon on specific time intervals.

    ### Possible C2 beaconing set-up

    A threat actor can set C2 server to respond in one of the following ways.

    - Fixed intervals: The beacon sends signals at fixed intervals, e.g., every
      5 minutes, 1 hour, or 24 hours.
    - Randomised intervals: The beacon sends signals at randomised intervals,
      e.g., between 5-15 minutes, to make it harder to detect.
    - Scheduled intervals: The beacon sends signals at specific times, e.g.,
      during business hours or when the system is most active.
    
    ### Threat actor's purposes

    Attackers can set a specific timing or rules in their Command and Control
    servers depends on different reasons and goals.

    - Evade detection: By beaconing at regular intervals, the attacker can avoid
      detection by security systems that rely on anomaly detection or behavioral
      analysis.
    - Maintain stealth: By using fixed or randomized intervals, the attacker can
      make it harder for security teams to detect the beaconing activity.
    - Conserve resources: By only communicating at specific intervals, the
      attacker can conserve resources, such as bandwidth and system resources,
      on the compromised system.
