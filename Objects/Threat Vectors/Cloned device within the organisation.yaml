    A cloned device is already in the organisation, it is fully operational 
    (as the original device is fully onboarded, the clone has exactly the 
    same config and will appear on the console as another instance of the 
    same device)
  targets:
    - Laptop
    - Workstations
    - Mobile phone
    - Identity Services
  platforms:
    - Windows
    - macOS
    - Linux
    - Active Directory
    - Azure AD
    - Android
  severity: Significant incident
  leverage:
    - Spoofing
    - Infrastructure Compromise
    - Information Disclosure
  impact:
    - Data Breach
    - Reputational Damages
    - Business disruption
  viability: Roughly even chance

    A cloned-device attack exploits critical gaps in how enterprises bind
    digital identity to physical hardware. By obtaining device-registration 
    secret during build or repair, an adversary can bootstrap a second machine 
    whose BIOS UUID, TPM endorsement key and MDM certificates are byte-for-byte 
    identical to a legitimate laptop already enrolled. From the CMDB's perspective 
    nothing abnormal occurs: the original asset record continues to map to what 
    are now two live endpoints.

    Because both hosts share every credential artefact, the rogue clone can
    authenticate in parallel from any network segment : roaming Wi-Fi,
    residential broadband, or even a rented cloud workstation; while the real
    employee carries on unaware. Conditional Access and NAC engines see the
    correct device SID, compliance hash, and health attestation, so policy
    gates swing open. This dual presence enables the attacker to blend their
    traffic with routine office activity, drastically lowering detection
    probability.
