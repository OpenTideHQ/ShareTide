      description: |
        North Korean cyberespionage campaign distributes a spear-phishing
        e-mails which contains a link to download a password-protected
        file containing a LNK file. In this campaign the threat actor
        try to lure the victims to download a malicious LNK file on
        their workstations.

    Threat actor rely on social engineering techniques for initial access.
    For example, well customised and legitimate looking company e-mail with
    administrative document protected with passwords or titled with ongoing
    meeting or agenda.  
  targets:
    - Customer
    - End-user
    - Workstations
  platforms:
    - Office 365
    - Github # the archive included a .lnk file, which would download payloads from a GitHub repository
  severity: Moderate incident

    - Infrastructure Compromise
    - Tampering

    - Business disruption
    - Lose Capabilities
    - Data Breach

    A malicious .lnk file can be crafted to execute arbitrary code, download
    malware, or exploit vulnerabilities in the operating system. The threat
    actors can use social engineering tactics to trick users into downloading
    and opening these files, which can lead to some of the following threats
    ref [1], [2]:

    - Malware infection: The .lnk file can download and install malware,
    such as viruses, Trojans, or ransomware, onto the workstation.
    - Code execution: The file can execute malicious code, potentially
    allowing attackers to gain control of the workstation or steal sensitive
    data.
    - Exploitation of vulnerabilities: Malicious .lnk files can exploit known
    vulnerabilities in the operating system or applications, leading to further
    compromise.

    In one of the observed and reported threat actor cyber-espionage campaigns
    a North Korean threat actor spreads spear-phishing e-mails containing a link
    to a password-protected document which contains LNK file.  

    The lure contains a e-mail with a title "Political Advisory Meeting to
    be held at the EU Delegation on May 14." This was both the e-mail subject
    and the name of a zip file sent through a Dropbox link. The mail contains
    a password-protected zip file with included .lnk file in it. Once an end-
    usr click this file, it will download a payload usually from a GitHub 
    repository. Further the payload executes and infect the host.
