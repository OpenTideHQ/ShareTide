  description: |
    MFA is a technique that requires more than one piece of evidence to authorize the user to 
    access a resource. If two pieces of evidence are needed to verify, this approach is called 2FA.
    The difference between 2FA and MFA is that 2FA requires only two factors; on the other hand,
    MFA can add more layers until the login attempts do not seem suspicious anymore.

    A MFA bypass is a broad term referring to an attack method where a cybercriminal 
    navigates around MFA requirements to gain unauthorized access to an account.
