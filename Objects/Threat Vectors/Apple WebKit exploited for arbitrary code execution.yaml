    WebKit is a cross-platform browser rendering engine used in Safari
    and other applications across macOS, iOS, and other platforms.
    
    Due to Apple's restrictions, even Chromium-based browsers on iOS,
    such as Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, rely on WebKit, making
    them vulnerable to this exploit as well. According to Apple,
    this issue may have been exploited against specific targeted
    individuals on versions of iOS before iOS 17.23 ref [2].    

    The WebKit vulnerability (CVE-2025-24201) is an out-of-bounds write 
    vulnerability and Apple notes it as a zero-day exploited remotely. 
    It allows attackers to bypass WebKit's sandbox and achieve arbitrary 
    code execution on affected devices. The vulnerability requires user
    interaction in order to be triggered. For more details ref [6].        

    The vulnerability requires user interaction in order to be triggered.
    From the analysis and the information in the reports what is known until
    now is that the exploit code is not publicly available and the Webkit
    component presents in software used by multiple Union entities.   

    From the available information until now, the known affected
    products are chromium-based browsers on the following platforms: 
    macOS, iOS, iPadOS ref [1], [2].  

    Apple is also known for emailing affected users, despite the 
    limited amount of information on the Threat Alert, as confirmed by 
    CERT-EU, in case of exploitation detected by Apple notification 
    will be sent.
