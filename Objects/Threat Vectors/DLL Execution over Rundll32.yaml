    Adversary must have enough privileges on the Windows host to bypass application
    control solutions via the rundll32.exe process. Natively, rundll32.exe will load
    DLLs and is a great example of a Living off the Land Binary.

  description: |
    Rundll32.exe is a powerful asset for adversaries to proxy execution of arbitrary
    and malicious code. It is flexible and efficient for loading code into memory,
    as may load malicious DLLs by ordinals, function names or directly.
    Rundll32.exe has a certain degree of trust; which can result in a possible
    AppLocker and Software Restriction Policies (SRP) bypass.

    Adversaries rely on distinct vectors to infect their targets, who might get
    infected. Upon successful exploitation, malicious actors have been seen executing
    DLL files using Rundll32.exe for multiple purposes; such as download and execute a
    payload from a remote server (DLL path could be both local and remote when the DLL
    is hosted on a SMB share using UNC paths), contact C&C server to upload stolen data
    or dump LSASS process memory to obtain credentials.
