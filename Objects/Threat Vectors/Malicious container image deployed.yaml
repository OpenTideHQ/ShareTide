    The adversary need to be able to inject malicious code into
    container image which will be deployed in target environment. 
    This can be achieved by putting malicious image into public 
    registry and tricking developer into using it, getting access
    into internal CI/CD pipeline, uploading modified image into 
    internal registry or running the image directly 
    on compromised host. 
  targets:
    - CI/CD Pipelines
    - Code Repositories
    - Software Containers
    - Microservices
  platforms:
    - AWS
    - Azure
    - Docker Engine
    - Kubernetes
    - Linux
  severity: Significant incident
  leverage:
    - Dwelling
    - Elevation of privilege
    - Infrastructure Compromise
    - Software installation
  impact:
    - Data Breach
    - Business disruption
    - Operating costs
  viability: Likely
  description: |
    Threat actors plant malicious code into container images which 
    execute in target environment. This vector is used to perform 
    cryptominning activities and as a persistence technique.
