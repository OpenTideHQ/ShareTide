    This threat vector refers to adversaries running scripts or commands directly 
    on Azure virtual machines via built-in features, enabling malicious code execution 
    and system compromise.

    ## Example Attack Scenario
    An attacker gains access to Azure portal credentials (via phishing or leaked secrets), 
    allowing privilege escalation to interact with the management plane of Azure resources. 
    The attacker then uses features like **RunCommand**, **CustomScriptExtension**, 
    or **Serial Console** to execute PowerShell or shell scripts directly on a targeted VM. 
    For instance, leveraging **CustomScriptExtension**, the intruder injects a script 
    to dump credentials, establish persistence, or exfiltrate sensitive files—all as SYSTEM user.

    ## Attack Goals and Impact
    - The primary **goal** is to execute arbitrary commands with SYSTEM privileges, 
    enabling full compromise of the VM and escalation to additional assets connected to the VM.
    - **Impact** includes:
      - Data exfiltration (sensitive file theft, database dumps)
      - Persistence (deploying webshells, creating new users)
      - Lateral movement (pivoting from VM to network or cloud resources)
      - Disruption (cryptomining, ransomware deployment)
      - Evasion (disabling defenses on the VM level).

    ## Attack Flow and Methodology
    1. The attacker identifies exposed or misconfigured Azure virtual machines, focusing 
      on accounts with management access.
    2. - The attacker uses management plane operations: for example, `Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/runCommand/action`, 
      `Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/extensions/write`, or serial console access.
      - Executes malicious scripts (PowerShell, Bash) as SYSTEM.
    3. - Harvests credentials, establishes persistence, or launches further attacks.
      - May leverage logging gaps to avoid detection, or clean up traces after execution.
    4. - Activity can be detected via auditing specific events such as `Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/extensions/write` 
      or anomalous use of VM scripting features.
