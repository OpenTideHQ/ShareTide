  description: |
    Adversaries maymimick known and trusted software packages and
    distributors, with the intent to be mistaken for the original developer,
    and thus deliver malicious code that will be embedded in the
    victim's applications. They may use sophisticated automation
    to appear convincing and fool the target. Once delivered, the package may
    contain any payload, from crypto mining, to credential theft, command and control etc.
