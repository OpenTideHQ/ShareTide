    A threat actors target to infect Internet of Things (IoT) devices
    for initial access and developement of a bot-net. 

    These IoT devices could include:
    - cheap routers with poor security standards;
    - industrial control systems (ICS); 
    - portable and phone devices which are very spread
  targets:
    - VPN Client
    - Router or switch
    - Mobile phone
    - Proxy
    - End-user
    - Other # VPS services that run the traffic through TOR and mainly compromised routers
    - Public-Facing Servers
  platforms:
    - Network Router
    - iOS

    Researchers found that cyber espionage groups with ties to China
    are increasingly using complicated proxy networks called Operational
    Relay Box (ORB) networks. These networks are made up of mesh networks
    made from hacked devices and commercially leased virtual private
    servers (VPS). By using these mesh networks the threat actors can
    conduct espionage operations, for example disguise external traffic
    between command and control (C2) infrastructure and victim
    environments ref [1, 3].    

    ORBs are similar to botnets but they may be a hybrid of commercially
    leased VPS services and compromised devices, including end-of-life
    routers and other IoT products. These network may include in some
    cases and vulnareble edge devices or networks composed by compromised
    devices like smartphones, IoT sensors, industrial robots or the
    combination between multiple smart (IoT), industrial or other type
    of portable or industrial internet of things devices ref [3].    

    The obfuscation networks are observed to have sevarel different
    version of the networks - for example, ORB primamry initial network,
    after it the upgraded ORB02 network or also known as "SuperJump"
    that comprises about 500 hosts. Several modifications of these
    type of network are observed as networks composed of “nodes,”
    or individual physical or virtual devices, that are typically
    routers or leased virtual private servers ref [a, 2].

    The entities targeted by this ORB network, named also as ORB02,
    are located in Europe and South America, and include a European
    Union entity.

    This activity occurred between August and November 2024. A government
    website directly associated with the G20 Summit held in Brazil in
    mid-November 2024 was among the likely targeted systems. 

    The targeted IP addresses are associated with moderate confidence
    to entities in Brazil, Peru, Spain, Slovenia, Romania, and the Czech
    Republic, as well as an EU entity. Several targeted IP addresses displayed
    characteristics consistent with websites, mail servers, name servers,
    government login pages, and systems hosting Fortinet and F5 BIG-IP
    appliances ref [a].  

    The connections likely represent operator activity such as reconnaissance
    between ORB02 nodes and the targeted entities systems. There is no evidence
    that the targeted entities were compromised ref [a].
