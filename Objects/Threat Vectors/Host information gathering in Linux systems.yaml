    Host information gathering in Linux can be a part of a reconnaissance
    process, allowing threat actors to understand the target system details and
    configuration, collect valuable information and identify potential
    vulnerabilities on the host.  

    ### Possible information gathering on Linux system

    - A hostname and domain name - a threat actor may use the `hostname` command
      to retrieve the system's hostname and domain name.
    - IP address: usage of `ip addr` or `ifconfig` commands can retrieve the
      system's IP address. The IP address of the system is a valuable piece of
      information for future collection and reconnaissance activities.
    - Network interface configuration: the command `ip link` or `ifconfig` is
      used to retrieve information about network interfaces, including IP
      addresses, subnet masks, and default gateways.
    - Operating system and version: a threat actor can use `uname -a` or
      `cat /etc/os-release` command to retrieve information about the operating
      system and its version. A command like `uname` can display information
      about the system, for example the kernel name, version, and the Linux
      architecture.  
    - Kernel Version: with the command `uname -r` an attacker can retrieve the
      kernel version of a targeted system.
    - CPU architecture: a threat actor may use the `uname -m` command to
      retrieve the CPU architecture. A threat actor may also use `lscpu` on Linux
      to gather CPU's capabilities like model information, number of cores,
      speeds, flags, virtualisation capabilities and other CPU related
      parameters ref [3]. 
    - Memory and disk information: an attacker can use `-m` and `df -h` commands
      to retrieve information about memory and disk usage. With other commands
      like `df`, `fdisk`, or `mount` they can check the system storage and to
      find the disks attached to the system ref [2], [3].  
    - Whois lookup: a threat actor can perform the command `whois` <domain_name>
      to retrieve which are the registered domains in the database record on
      the host.
    - Name server lookup: a threat actor can use `nslookup` on Linux to get the
      information from a DNS server. It queries DNS to obtain a domain name, IP
      address mapping, or any other DNS record. This coomand can be used for a
      system gathering of information. 
    - Environment variables: `env` or `printenv` can expose environment
      variables, which might include credentials, proxy settings, or session-
      related tokens useful for further exploitation.
    - Running processes and services: commands like `ps aux`, `top` can help a
      threat actor to identify active processes and services, which may reveal
      misconfigured applications or listening services.
    - Scheduled jobs: `crontab -l`, `cat /etc/crontab`, or reviewing
      `/etc/cron.*` directories can uncover automated tasks or persistence
      mechanisms.
    - Listening ports and services: `ss -tuln` or `netstat -tuln` can show
      services listening on the host, along with the associated ports and
      protocols.  
      
    ### Known tools used for Linux information gathering

    - Nmap: A network scanning tool that can be used to gather information about
      open ports and services.
    - LinEnum: A tool that can be used to gather information about Linux
      systems, including user and group information.
    - Zenmap - it's a network discovery and security auditing tool
    - SPARTA - tool used in the scanning and enumeration phase of information
      gathering on Linux systems. This tool can be used for network scanning and
      collection of information, for example scan of IP ranges, network and
      domain names ref [4].
