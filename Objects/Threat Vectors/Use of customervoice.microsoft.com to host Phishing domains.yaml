  description: |
    This threat vector is based on real phishing domains built and utilized by
    a real, still unknown threat actor. The subdomain 
    customervoice.microsoft.com should be blocked on forward proxies by most 
    organizations, unless they have legit reasons to have traffic to this, and
    legit traffic going there.
