  description: 
    Threat actors may wish to cause business disruption, media/public attention,
    or to use the pretense of business disruption to disguise other activities. 
    Any DDoS attack should always be followed up with other DFIR activities to 
    determine if the attack was meant to distract from something else. DDoS can 
    distract by pulling attention away, or even by spooling out log files so 
    that relevant entries are overwritten.
