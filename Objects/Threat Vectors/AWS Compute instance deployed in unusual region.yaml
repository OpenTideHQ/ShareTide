  description: |
    Certain threat actors will try to launch AWS compute instances 
    (EC2, EKS, ECS) instances to achieve their objectives
    
    One of the main vectors currently is to monetize access to 
    privileged AWS credentials by deploying new compute instances of various types 
    to mine cryptocurrencies. To hide their deployed instances, a threat actor 
    may deploying the resources into unused regions, where they may go 
    unnoticed.

    Additionally threat actor may launch compute instances to act as staging 
    platforms for serving malware for other campaigns.

    It is expected that threat actors will potentially use compute instances 
    for other purposes than the 2 listed above.
